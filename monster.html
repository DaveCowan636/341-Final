<p><div class="txt"> The Flathead Lake Monster is an animal that is said to be located in Flathead Lake. Its appearance is very similar to that of the Loch Ness Monster, and the two have often been said to be the same type of creature. The first documented sighting of the Flathead Lake Monster was in 1889. James C. Kerr skippered the U.S. Grant, a lake steamboat that made its rounds in Lake Flathead. On one trip Kerr and his passengers saw what first appeared to be a log or another approaching boat in the water. After coming closer, they realized an unusually large eel-like object was coming toward them in the lake.  Frightened, one of the passengers on the steamer pulled out the rifle that he was carrying. He did not kill the creature, but this sighting started the legend of the Flathead Lake Monster. The average number of sightings is between one and two each year.</p>
