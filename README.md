# 341-Final
Final 341


Im doing my final on a page for Flathead lake tourisum.  I used to go there every weekend of the summer camping and boating
when my kids were little, taking photos of the lake and the beauty it holds.  So I though for a final it would be 
a great topic to put together. Some of the pictures I will be using are ones I have personally taken and others will
be sourced from online media and business that they represent.  Ive been putting the layout together in photoshop
seeing how the pictures look together, the layout of the page, style I will use, and how I will locate links to 
the other pages. 
I worked on each page individually, I used a lot of the content layout from previouse assignments on these
pages, which made them go together a little easier.  The hardest page was the home page.  Try as I might
I could not get the images to line up like I wanted in my outline with one the width on top for a header image
and one then three in line down the left side and one large picture flowing down the right hand side.  Either the 
images would end up on top of eachother or in a strait line down the page, so after much frustration I compromised
and made the images span the full width of the page.
I sent out my site on FB to see what kind of peer reviews I would get on the site before finalizing it, most of the 
comments were good, with only a suggestion to change the font style on the page name so it didnt blend with the 
header menu.
I like how my site turned out, I think everything flows very well together.  I still would have liked the main
page to have the images layed out diffirently but am happy with this result.  The other thing I think I would have
expanded more on would have been some more information on the main page. I dont feel like I gave enough content on it
to really self explain what the site is. I feel like you get the idea pretty easly with what was done but it could
have more. Even looking at it if I would have made the beauty page with the extra content my main for the site and then used the 
main as my beauty page I think might have gotten me a little closer to what I wanted without having the main turn out
exactly as I had planned.
