# 341-Final
Final 341


Im doing my final on a page for Flathead lake tourisum.  I used to go there every weekend of the summer camping and boating
when my kids were little, taking photos of the lake and the beauty it holds.  So I though for a final it would be 
a great topic to put together. Some of the pictures I will be using are ones I have personally taken and others will
be sourced from online media and business that they represent.  Ive been putting the layout together in photoshop
seeing how the pictures look together, the layout of the page, style I will use, and how I will locate links to 
the other pages.
